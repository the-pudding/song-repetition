<h2>Per-artist repetitiveness</h2>
<p>Artists on the right are more repetitive. Use the radio buttons below to choose different decades. Artists are assigned a year based on the median of their charting songs.</p>
<p>Currently limited to artists with at least 20 charting songs. Probably want to tune that number (or take a fixed # per decade).</p>
